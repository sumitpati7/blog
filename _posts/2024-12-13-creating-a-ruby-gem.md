## Ruby Gem

A Ruby Gem is a module/library that you can install and use in your ruby programs or projects. Ruby Gems help to simplify your tasks by creating a block of code that can be reused as many times as much you want but you have to only write only on time.

## Creating a Gem

We can create a gem using the bundler, which provides the basic structure of the Gem project pre built. But in this project we will be building the gem without using the bundler.
